1. naive bayesian classifier will use all features
   from the train dataset
2. Run "naive_bayes.m"
3. Calculate prior, mean, variance using training dataset
4. From test dataset calculate  likelihood, posterior
   and finally error percentage 
5. In output prior, variance and error percentage is shown
